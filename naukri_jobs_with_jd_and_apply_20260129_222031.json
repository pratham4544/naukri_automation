We Believe It Starts With Education.\nIn India, 100 million children from low-income communities grow up without access to the 21st-century skills they need to thrive from emotional intelligence and digital literacy to everyday money management.\nThis gap leads to a lifetime of limited opportunity, inter-generational poverty, and rising mental health concerns.\n\n\nWhat Are We Doing\nIndia s classrooms are stuck in the past. We re building what kids need for the future.\nAt The Apprentice Project (TAP), we re rewriting the rules of learning using AI to unlock deeply personalized, adaptive education for every child, no matter their background. Our flagship product, TAP Buddy, is an AI-powered learning companion that doesn t just deliver content it understands how kids think, learn, and grow.\nAt the heart of it lies PAL (Personalized Adaptive Learning) a bold, AI-first engine powered by NLP, RAG models, graph databases, and student insight loops. PAL is the brain behind TAP Buddy and now, we re looking for the technologist who ll help us build this brain someone who thrives at the intersection of AI, backend systems, and full-stack problem-solving.\nThis isn t a feature build. It s a moonshot. It s a chance to build an AI system that changes how India learns.\n\n\nWho We re Looking For\nWe re looking for an AI engineer who s as excited about building models as about making them work in the real world.\nYou ve built or fine-tuned transformer-based models, implemented RAG systems, or worked with embeddings and graph databases.\nYou can design APIs one day, optimize inference pipelines the next, and still have energy left to make sure the dashboard looks beautiful.
